# network-growth-models
Some simulations of network models, with focus on preferential attachment

This project is still under progress.

Even though it is true that is impossible to generate absolute results, these simulations will at least help to show that different models will produce networks with different characteristics. 
The goal here is to understand the dynamics of network growth and to look (if possible) for unexpected results.
